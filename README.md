# SIassignment1code
<br>We have completed the assignment by creating 2 services in the form of a restful service and a grpc service. Then we have a soap implementation in a client that also proves that the information on the Resful service can be accessed by an outside client.
<br><br>To get the code to work the resful service called my-students needs to run before running the main in the soapservice.
